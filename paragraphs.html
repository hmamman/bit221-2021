    <h1>Memos</h1>
    <p>A memo is any paper document that is used for official communication between two parties. The communication can be Organisation-to-Organisation or Department-to-Department. External-In memo is a memo coming into the organisation from another organisation while a memo that goes out to another organisation is called Internal-Out memo. Memos that are initiated and terminated within the organisation are Internal memos. Memos are kept and moved from office-to-office within the organisation in a sheet of half-folded heavy paper material called file folder.</p>
    <p>File folder, or simply file, can be classified as either open file or secret file. Open files are used for keeping internal memos and also moving them around from office-to-office within the organisation and are found in open registry and other departments and units within the organisation. Departments and units can have as many open files as they require. </p>
